<!-- Testing the communication manager on a robot. It should be able to filter out garbage signals both from outside world and from the robot. 

Testing signal propagation: 
Publish an incoming valid task on /arc/test_bot/wifi_handler/incoming_requests => It should go through communication manager and be published on /arc/test_bot/communication_manager/task_requests
	
Other tests:
	task with id <=0: It should fail, as only positive id's are allowed.
	task with task_name not found in task_handler/valid_tasks: Should be ignored
	task with created time <=0: Fail: created time must be positive integer
